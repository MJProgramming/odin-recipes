# odin-recipes

This project will contain a website, where you can inspect and view different
recipes. It will contain anchor elements which are used for the navigation
within the index.html file. Furthermore, all different html files will contain
lists which are step by step guides on how to cook specific food (because
of this there mainly will be ordered lists). At the top ofthe index.html file, 
there will be a image relating to the topic of food and cooking.
