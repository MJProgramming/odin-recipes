        <h2 class="odinheader">Description</h2>
        <p>We took a couple of shortcuts for this recipe by using shop-bought pasta sauce and boxed pasta sheets. It saves a ton of time without sacrificing any flavour. We think it's absolutely perfect as-is, but also understand some people are looking to make sauce from scratch. Regardless of the route you go, make sure to follow these tips.</p>
        <h3 class="odinheader" >Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>350 g lasagne pasta sheets </li>
            <li>1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>450 g beef mince</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tsp. dried oregano</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>900 g ready-made tomato pasta sauce</li>
            <li>450 g ricotta</li>
            <li>50 g freshly grated Parmesan</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. chopped parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>700 g mozzarella, sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="odinheader">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 190ºC (170ºC fan). In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent the sheets from sticking together.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook beef until no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon, then drain fat. Return beef to pan and add garlic and oregano and stir for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, then add tomato sauce and stir until warmed through.</li>
            <li>Combine ricotta, 25g Parmesan, and parsley in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large casserole dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce, a single layer of lasagne pasta sheets, a layer of ricotta mixture, and a  single layer of mozzarella, then repeat layers. Top last layer of sheets with meat sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 200ºC and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley and serve.</li>
        </ol>
